**04 June 2021**  

Use the dataset in https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia and develop an intelligent system do detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Consider the following steps: 

1. Explore the data and define appropriate classes 
1. Visualize data and employ appropriate preprocessing to X-ray images 
1. Develop the detection algorithms 
   1. Using features and classical machine learning techniques 
   1. Using a neural network architecture (you may investigate various architectures or use an existing one) 
1. Present the results of your algorithms (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.)
